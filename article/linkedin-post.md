When Tailwind CSS laid off its entire team in January 2025, the project seemed doomed. Within 48 hours, Google, Vercel, and four other companies stepped in with emergency funding.

Tailwind got lucky. Most open source projects don't.

Every AI model, every web application, every "10x developer" tool you use today runs on open source infrastructure. The explosion of AI-powered coding has unleashed thousands of individual creators building on this foundation.

But here's the problem: open source doesn't pay. The maintainer of core-js—downloaded 9 billion times, powering half the internet—made $400 a month before burning out. 60% of open source maintainers work for free. 60% are considering quitting.

As AI democratizes software creation, we're about to see an explosion of projects built on infrastructure that's already collapsing. More creators, same broken funding model, predictable outcome.

Now here's the twist: memecoins—typically dismissed as scams, zero-sum speculation—generated over $600,000 in royalties for open source projects in just two weeks.

Yes, you read that right. The "scam" is funding infrastructure that powers the legitimate economy.

We wrote a case study examining how this works, why it might actually be sustainable, and what it means for the future of software development.

Tailwind CSS laid off its team. Google rescued them 48 hours later.

Most open source maintainers aren't that lucky.

The core-js developer—9 billion downloads, powers half the internet—earned $400/month before burning out. 60% of maintainers work for free. As AI unleashes thousands of new creators, they're all building on infrastructure that's already collapsing.

Meanwhile, memecoins—typically considered zero-sum scams—generated over $600,000 in royalties for open source developers in just two weeks.

1/ When Tailwind CSS laid off its entire team in January, the project seemed finished. Within 48 hours, Google, Vercel, and 4 other companies rescued it with emergency funding.

2/ Tailwind got lucky because it's visible. Most open source infrastructure is invisible—and broke.

3/ The core-js developer maintained code downloaded 9 billion times. He made $400/month before burning out. 60% of OSS maintainers work unpaid. 60% are considering quitting.

4/ AI-powered coding is unleashing thousands of individual creators. They're all building on infrastructure that's already collapsing. More projects, same broken funding model, predictable outcome.

5/ Now here's the twist: memecoins—typically dismissed as zero-sum scams—generated over $600,000 in OSS royalties in just 2 weeks.
